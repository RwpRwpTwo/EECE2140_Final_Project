# Final Project for Computing Fundamentals for Engineers (EECE 2140)

This is my final project for my computing fundamentals class which focuses on
object-oriented programming in Python.

Non-default required python libraries:
1. Matpotlib
2. scipy
3. numpy

The program was written and tested within a conda environment.
Theoretically it should work in a python instance with the packages listed above installed,
however that has not been tested. Run the program from the main.py file. 

The program was written and tested in windows. There is limited use of the system library 
for the user to add csv files to automatically import when running the program from the console.
It is unknown if this library will work the same on macbooks. This function is optional, the data
can be imported manually in the program by using the import portal and entering the file path to 
the data.
