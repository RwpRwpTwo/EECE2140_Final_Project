# Final Project for Computing Fundamentals for Engineers (EECE 2140)

This is my final project for my computing fundamentals class which focuses on
object-oriented programming in Python.

Non-default required python libraries:
1. Matpotlib
2. scipy
3. numpy

The program was written and tested within a conda environment.
Theoretically it should work in a python instance with the packages listed above installed,
however that has not been tested. Run the program from the main.py file.
